# PWA

This repository consists of two projects who works together in order to demonstrate the capabilities of a Progressive Web App using a simple example :
- [QR-PWA][1] the Progressive Web App itself
- [QR-API][2] the API behind some of the PWA's functionalities

Both solutions are meant to be hosted on Microsoft Azure's cloud

## [QR-PWA][1]

This project is a simple web app using web technologies (html, js, etc.)

## [QR-API][2]

This project is an api developed in ```C#``` with the dotnet framework : ```.net core``` and ```.net 4.6``` (to be compatible with azure APIs)
